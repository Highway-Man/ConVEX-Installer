The ConVEX Installer is an installer for (1) the Convex library created by James Pearman and available at https://github.com/jpearman/convex, (2) the New ConVEX Project Plugin for PROS Eclipse, and (3) the pololu GNU make utilty. This installer provides a handy alternative to copying these files to the necessary directories manually; however, all of this installer's components can be installed by hand. That is, this installer is not required to use Convex, etc. 

Make sure that you already have PROS installed and working properly before running this installer. You will need to know the location of the PROS workspace (usually youruserfolder\pros) and the location of the PROS installation (eg C:\Program Files (x86)\PROS) in order to use this installer. This is because the Convex library and other components need to be extracted to the correct directories in order for them to function correctly. 

This installer will prompt the user for the components to install (ie the user can choose to just install the Convex library and not the New ConVEX Project Plugin or the make utility). This installer can also be used as a means of updating an installation or adding components to it.

To use the installer, download ConVEX-Setup.exe and run it. The wizard will prompt you for the necessary information and install the selected files. The source is provided for reference and is not needed to use the installer.
